  <h1> CLIMATE CHANGE </h1>
  <div>Jisun Ellie Chang, Matthew Dillard, Sofia Xu</div>

  <h2>Who's sowing, and who's reaping</h2>

  <p>
    Climate change is an ever present worry for us all, but the reality is that the inevitable repurcussions of decades
    of pollution will disproportionately affect developing countries: those who contributed very little to the problem
    we as a planet currently face, and do often not have the necessary infrastructure to manage the problem. Taking air pollution - the combination of outdoor and indoor particulate matter, and ozone – as an example. 
  </p>

  <p>
    From the world map of CO2 emission from 1990 - 2020 below, we see that North America, Oceania, Europe, and Latin America have disproportionately high emissions relative to their population. North America is home to only five percent of the world population but emits nearly 18 percent of CO2 (almost four times as much). Asia and Africa are underrepresented in emissions. Asia is home to 60 percent of the population but emits just 49 percent; Africa has 16 percent of the population but emits just 4 percent of CO2. This is reflected in per capita emissions; the average North American is more than 17 times higher than the average African.
  </p>

  <p>
    We can see a predictable trend that richer, more developed countries contributing at much higher rates than developing countries. This inequality in global emissions lies at the heart of why international agreement on climate change has (and continues to be) so contentious. The richest countries of the world are home to half of the world population, and emit 86 percent of CO2 emissions.

  <p>
    Who is most affected by air pollution? In the interactive map below, we show death rates from pollution across the world, measured as the number of deaths per 100,000 people of a given country or region. Rates are age-standardized, meaning they assume a constant age structure of the population to allow for comparisons between countries and over time. 
  </p>

  <p> 
    What we see in the Dealth Rate from Air Pollution map is almost opposite to what we see in the CO2 emission map - countries with the largest CO2 contribution are mostly from North America and Asia with disporportionately large
    GDP and industry scale.  The countries with highest air pollution-related death rate are Central African Republic, Afghanistan, Papua New Guinea, Guinea, and Sierra Leone. Including these five countries, Africa and the Carribean are regions that are hit with the highest death rates. Since decades ago, multinational corporates have established factories and powerplants in such regions and continued to expand their commercial activities. To this date, the death rates have gone mostly unnoticed by developed countries.
  </p>

  <p>
    This highlights the large differences globally: death rates in the highest burden countries are more than 100 times greater than across much of Europe and North America. The burden of air pollution tends to be greater across both low and middle income countries for two reasons: air pollution rates tend to be high in low-income countries due to a reliance on solid fuels for cooking; and outdoor air pollution tends to increase as countries industrialize and shift from low-to-middle incomes.

  <h2>What's to come</h2>

  <p>
    CRI, short for the Global Climate Risk Index, is a figure developed by Germanwatch with the goal of analyzing the
    quantitative impacts of extreme weather events in terms of the cost of both human and financial losses. A country's
    ranking, based on their number of fatalities, fatalities per 100,000 inhabitants, losses per million US$, and losses
    per unit GDP, all resultant from these extreme weather events.
  </p>

  <div id="chartdiv"></div>

  <p>
    Predictably, most of these countries are either in warm, coastal or island regions who are frequented by tropical storms,
    or regions subject to extreme temperatures which may causes droughts and famines. But under the surface, there is
    more at play. The disparities, and where much of the inequality comes from in regard to who is most in danger of climate
    change resultant events, is in how and what those losses are. Poorer, developing countries which are in danger of
    climate disasters are at much greater risk because they lack the infrastructure to prepare for and recover from
    these disasters compared to richer countries. If we take a look at Canada, for instance, it has a CRI
    score of 87.33. It ranked 15th in the world in average loss in millions of US$ from 2000-2019, but 83rd in average loss
    per unit GDP in that same time period. China had the highest cumulative financial loss from 2000-2019, but ranked 60th in
    terms of its GDP. Rich countries are able to mitigate the damages due to their economic resources, and continue to
    allow their citizens to live sufficiently even if disaster strikes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Poorer countries do not have this same luxury. These are the 10 countries that Germanwatch determined to be the most
    at risk for frequent, or rare but catastrophic weather events that result from climate change along with their CRI
    score, and qualitative categories.
  </p>

    <button class="chart-button" id="cri_button" onclick="update(cri_data)" autofocus>CRI Score</button>

    <button class="chart-button" onclick="update(num_events)">Number of Events</button>
  </div>

  <div id="my_dataviz"></div>

  <p>
    For many of these countries, damages from climate disasters accounts for a significant part of their total GDP. Across
    these ten, the average ranking for loss per until GDP was 21st. The positive feedback loop of loss, incomplete recovery,
    and further loss means that many of the developing and poor countries more affected by climate change will continue to
    sink lower in poverty. A government which is financially unable to support infrastructure to protect its citizens,
    and unable to rebuilt when catastrophe strikes, will mean that loss of life, personal hardship, and existential threats
    will become more and more widespread for the foreseeable future. Investments from those countries able to minimize and provide
    large scale climate change protections and preventions (who also happen to be those most contributing to the problem)
    will as a result be helping countries that may not be able to do the same for themselves, but are nonetheless having
    to deal with the mess they made.

  <h2> Who is contributing and who is not? </h2>

  <p>
    On December 12th 2015, 195 countries at COP 21 in Paris came together to adopt the Paris Agreement, a legally binding
    international treaty on climate change. The goal of the Paris aAgreement is to <b> limit global warming to below 2, preferably
    1.5 degrees Celsius </b> compared to preindustrial levels. The Paris Agreement works on a 5-year cycle of climate action carried
    out by each country. By 2020, the end of the first cycle, countries submit their climate action plans known as <b> nationally determined
    contributions (NDCs). </b> NDC signifies actions they will take to reduce their Greenhouse Gas emissions in order to reach the Paris
    Agreement Goals.

  </p>

  <div id="project_count"></div>
  <script>
    $( "#project_count" ).load( "img/choropleth_project_count.html");
  </script>

  <p>
    
    GCF is a unique global platform to respond to climate change by investing in <b>low-emission and climate-resilient development. </b> 
    It is the world’s largest climate fund, mandated to support developing countries raise and realize their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) ambitions,
    climate plans from each country that highlight climate actions and targets.
    GCF was established by 194 governments to limit or reduce Greenhouse Gas emissions in developing countries, and to help vulnerable
    societies adapt to the impacts of climate change. The GCF serves the Paris Agreement in accordance with paragraph 8 of Article 9 of the
    Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement also states that institutions serving the Agreement such as GCF shall aim to ensure efficient access to
    financial resources through simplified approval procedures and enhanced readiness support, in particular for the least developed countries (LDCs)
    of their national climate strategies and plans.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, COVID-19 has posed major challenges upon GCF operations and will continue to do so indefinitely. As of November 2020, the total number
    of approved funding proposals stands at 159, and the total amount of GCF funding is USD 7.2 billion. These projects are expected to reduce a total of
    <b> 1.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent of greenhouse gas. </b>
  </p>

  <p>
    Above is an interactive map showing GCF projects worldwide. Each GCF project varies widely differently in their purpose, industry, funding type,
    and funding value. Projects for intance are listed next including, but not limited to: promoting risk mitigation for renewable eneregy and energy efficiency
    investments in Argentia, scaling up investment in Low-Carbon Public Buildings in Bosina, The Amazon biome rebuilding in Brazil, and more.
  </p>

      $( "#sector_fig" ).load( "img/pie_fig_sector.html");

    <div id="theme_fig"></div>
    <script>
      $( "#theme_fig" ).load( "img/pie_fig_theme.html");
    </script>
  </div>

  <p>
  The two pie charts above categorize available GCF projects into two major elements. More than 3/4 of projects are funded by the public sector (80.4%), while
  the others are funded by the private sector (19.6%). There are three major themes among the projects: Adaptation type, mitigation type, and
  cross-cutting type in the order of frequency. Adaptation projects (43.4% of total) aim to improve community and ecoystem resilience.
  On the other hand, mitigation projects seek to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or to increase the capacity of carbon sinks. Lastly, cross-cutting
  projects have a hybrid approach using the previous two. 
  
  </p>
  The GCF data shows that there are mostly one or two ongoing GCF initiatives in the available countries, with some ranging to 4. Not only that currently
  the GCF has not gained enough coverage around the world, but also the number of projects per country is still low. Evidently, still a huge chunk of Least
  Developed Countries are left blank in the map meaning there hasn't been an international effort to establish a GCF initaitive in the area. While the Paris Agreement
  has several other indicators to measure its progress, the GCF, one of the major pillars of the Agreement, is not as progressing as we would like to think.
  
  <p>
  While developed countries are actively holding themselves accountable to adhere to targets of the Paris Agreement, they are still overlooking the critical fact
  that greenhouse gas emission and climate change in general cannot be noticeably improved if there is not enough international cooperation to help the most vulnerable
  and affected countries. Much of the Paris Agreeement's sentiment lies on a self-serving pace where the main objective is to keep each country with their Nationally Determiend
  Contributions. Developed countries must make more conscious efforts into looking at the environmental inequality happening worldwide and how they are perhaps the perpetrators
  of inequality themselves. More actions need to be made in helping the severely impacted countries through the meeans of GCF, independent projects from corporates, and many
  more official and unofficial means.
