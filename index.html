  <h1> CLIMATE CHANGE </h1>

  <hr>

  <h2>Who's sowing, and who's reaping</h2>

  <p>
    Climate change is an ever present worry for us all, but the reality is that the inevitable repurcussions of decades
    of pollution will disproportionately affect developing countries: those who contributed very little to the problem
    we as a planet currently face, and do often not have the necessary infrastructure to manage the problem. Here we see
    CO2 emissions per capita of all countries since 1990. The predictable trend we see is that richer, more developed
    countries contributing at much higher rates than developing countries.
  </p>

  <div id="emissions"></div>
  <script>
    $( "#emissions" ).load( "img/animated_choropleth_emission.html");
  </script>

  <p>
    What we see in the CO2 contribution chart above is almost opposite to what we see in those countries most affected by
    that same pollution.

  <h2>What's to come</h2>

  <p>
    CRI, short for the Global Climate Risk Index, is a figure developed by Germanwatch with the goal of analyzing the
    quantitative impacts of extreme weather events in terms of the cost of both human and financial losses. A country's
    ranking, based on their number of fatalities, fatalities per 100,000 inhabitants, losses per million US$, and losses
    per unit GDP, all resultant from these extreme weather events.
  </p>

  <div id="chartdiv"></div>

  <p>
    Predictably, most of these countries are either in warm, coastal or island regions frequented by tropical storms,
    or regions subject to extreme temperatures which may causes droughts and famines. But under the surface, there is
    more at play. The disparities, and where much of the inequality comes from in regard to who is most in danger of climate
    change resultant events, is in how and what those losses are. It's not just about who is in the most dangerous area.
    Poorer, developing countries in danger of disasters are at much greater risk because they lack the infrastructure to prepare for and recover from
    these disasters compared to richer countries. If we take a look at Canada, for instance, it has a CRI
    score of 87.33. It ranked 15th in the world in millions of US$ lost to climate disasters, but 83rd in average loss
    per unit GDP in that same time period. Even though the absolute loss felt by many of these wealthier countries is much
    higher relative to the rest of the world, their economic foundations, production, and relations provide a means of
    tanking these climate disasters, and bouncing back.
  </p>

  <p>
    Poorer countries do not have this same luxury. These are the 10 countries that Germanwatch determined to be the most
    at risk for frequent, or rare but catastrophic weather events that result from climate change along with their CRI
    score, and qualitative categories.
  </p>

  <div class="button-row">
    <button class="chart-button" id="cri_button" onclick="update(cri_data)" autofocus>CRI Score</button>
    <button class="chart-button" onclick="update(fatal_data)">Fatalities</button>
    <button class="chart-button" onclick="update(fatal_100_data)">Fatalities per 100K</button>

    <button class="chart-button" onclick="update(losses_GDP)">Losses per unit GDP</button>
    <button class="chart-button" onclick="update(num_events)">Number of Events</button>
  </div>

  <div id="my_dataviz"></div>

  <p>
    For many of these countries, damages from climate disasters accounts for a significant part of their total GDP. Across
    these ten, the average ranking for loss per until GDP was 21st. The positive feedback loop of loss, incomplete recovery,
    and further loss means that many of the developing and poor countries more affected by climate change will continue to
    sink lower in poverty. A government which is financially unable to support infrastructure to protect its citizens,
    and unable to rebuilt when catastrophe strikes, will mean that loss of life, personal hardship, and existential threats
    will become more and more widespread.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's compare Japan and Haiti, for instance. Japan had a CRI score of 64.83, and Haiti 13.67. Japan ranked 57th in
    the world in CRI score, and Haiti ranked 3rd. If you were to look at purely absolute losses, Japan and Haiti would
    appear rather comparable. Japan ranked 21st and 4th in total fatalities and total financial losses, whereas Haiti
    ranked 13th and 41st in those same categories. Why does Japan seem to be a much lower risk? Because relative to
    fatalities per capita, and loss per unit GDP instead, Japan sits closer to the middle of of the pack, at 90th and 92nd,
    whereas Haiti ends up at 4th and 10th. The inequality between developed and developing countries means that losses
    are felt more often, more deeply, and for longer for developing countries.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the current moment, it is a lost cause to expect these disastrous events to slow down, let alone stop. While
    investment in renewable energy sources, shifting away from fossil fuels, and cracking down on pollution are all
    vital steps in preserving our planet's health, many of these changes appear to aimed at long term, and should be
    fronted by the worst offenders: the wealthiest countries. Those at the most risk, especially the developing
    countries, need assistance in not only building up a sustainable national infrastructure, but also implementing
    governments and systems that will facilitate positive growth.
