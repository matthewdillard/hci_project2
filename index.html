  <h1> CLIMATE CHANGE </h1>

  <h2>Who's sowing, and who's reaping</h2>

  <p>
    Climate change is an ever present worry for us all, but the reality is that the inevitable repurcussions of decades
    of pollution will disproportionately affect developing countries: those who contributed very little to the problem
    we as a planet currently face, and do often not have the necessary infrastructure to manage the problem. Here we see
    CO2 emissions per capita of all countries since 1990. The predictable trend we see is that richer, more developed
    countries contributing at much higher rates than developing countries.
  </p>

  <div id="pollution"></div>
  <script>
    $( "#pollution" ).load( "img/animated_choropleth_pollution.html");
  </script>

  <p>
    What we see in the CO2 contribution chart above is almost opposite to what we see in those countries most affected by
    that same pollution.

  <h2>What's to come</h2>

  <p>
    CRI, short for the Global Climate Risk Index, is a figure developed by Germanwatch with the goal of analyzing the
    quantitative impacts of extreme weather events in terms of the cost of both human and financial losses. A country's
    ranking, based on their number of fatalities, fatalities per 100,000 inhabitants, losses per million US$, and losses
    per unit GDP, all resultant from these extreme weather events.
  </p>

  <div id="chartdiv"></div>

  <p>
    Predictably, most of these countries are either in warm, coastal or island regions who are frequented by tropical storms,
    or regions subject to extreme temperatures which may causes droughts and famines. But under the surface, there is
    more at play. The disparities, and where much of the inequality comes from in regard to who is most in danger of climate
    change resultant events, is in how and what those losses are. Poorer, developing countries which are in danger of
    climate disasters are at much greater risk because they lack the infrastructure to prepare for and recover from
    these disasters compared to richer countries. If we take a look at Canada, for instance, it has a CRI
    score of 87.33. It ranked 15th in the world in average loss in millions of US$ from 2000-2019, but 83rd in average loss
    per unit GDP in that same time period. China had the highest cumulative financial loss from 2000-2019, but ranked 60th in
    terms of its GDP. Rich countries are able to mitigate the damages due to their economic resources. Without
  </p>

  <p>
    Poorer countries do not have this same luxury. These are the 10 countries that Germanwatch determined to be the most
    at risk for frequent, or rare but catastrophic weather events that result from climate change along with their CRI
    score, and qualitative categories.

  <p>
    For many of these countries, damages from climate disasters accounts for a significant part of their total GDP. Across
    these ten, the average ranking for loss per until GDP was 21st. The positive feedback loop of loss, incomplete recovery,
    and further loss means that many of the developing and poor countries more affected by climate change will continue to
    sink lower in poverty. A government which is financially unable to support infrastructure to protect its citizens,
    and unable to rebuilt when catastrophe strikes, will mean that loss of life, personal hardship, and existential threats
    will become more and more widespread.

  <!-- Section 3 Efforts-->
  <p>
    On December 12th 2015, 195 countries at COP 21 in Paris came together to adopt the Paris Agreement, a legally binding
    international treaty on climate change. The goal of the Paris aAgreement is to <b> limit global warming to below 2, preferably
    1.5 degrees Celsius </b> compared to preindustrial levels. The Paris Agreement works on a 5-year cycle of climate action carried
    out by each country. By 2020, the end of the first cycle, countries submit their climate action plans known as <b> nationally determined
    contributions (NDCs). </b> NDC signifies actions they will take to reduce their Greenhouse Gas emissions in order to reach the Paris Agreeement
    Goals.

  <!-- insert GCF data here-->
  
  <p>
    GCF is a unique global platform to respond to climate change by investing in <low-emission and climate-resilient development.
    GCF was established by 194 governments to limit or reduce Greenhouse Gas emissions in developing countries, and to help vulnerable
    societies adapt to the impacts of climate change. The GCF serves the Paris Agreement in accordance with paragraph 9 of Article 9 of the Paris Agreement.
